# AlphaAdvantage-StockDataPull
Pulling data from AlphaAdvantage.com for trade strategy backtesting

This script gets the S&P 500 from wikipedia then logs OHLCV data future backtesting purposes

I run this script hourly Tues-Sat because there are sometimes web-timouts.  These check for valid files, by size, and will repull on error.
